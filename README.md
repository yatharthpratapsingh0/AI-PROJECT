Jarvis is a Python-based voice assistant that performs tasks through voice commands.
It supports speech recognition with a wake word (“Jarvis”) and converts replies to speech using pyttsx3/gTTS.
The assistant can open websites, play music, fetch latest news headlines using NewsAPI, and handle general queries.
For complex questions, it integrates OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo via API to generate intelligent responses.
This project demonstrates end-to-end workflow design: speech input → intent detection → API call → response handling → voice output.
